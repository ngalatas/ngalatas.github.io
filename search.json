    "text": "About Me\n\nHello! This is my personal website, which presents my academic background as a master’s student in data-related studies, along with selected projects, code, and research interests in economics, public policy, and legal studies.\nI am pursuing a B.S. in Public Policy and an M.S. in Social Data and Analytics, with a graduate certificate in Geospatial Information Science. I am also completing a credential in Legal Research and a minor in Asian Studies. As a detail-oriented Public Policy student, my work focuses on policy effectiveness, the economic impacts of government action, and governmental implementation and interpretation of law. I am particularly interested in the use of computational methods and coding to analyze textual, spatial, economic, and web-based data in public policy and legal research contexts.\n\n\n\nMy Personal Life\n\nOutside of my academic work, I enjoy cultivating both creative and exploratory interests. I am an avid plant enthusiast and gardener, volunteering at the UT Dallas Eco Hub. I also enjoy crocheting and have expanded my garden to include fake plants that are crocheted, felted, and even built out of legos.\nIn my free time, I also love reading reading history books and science fiction. Recent books that I have enjoyed include King: A Life by Jonathan Eig and The Sparrow by Mary Doria Russell. With the Olympics underway, Pour ne pas disparaître by Gabriella Papadakis is next on my reading list.\nFinally, one of my major passions is traveling. I have had the opportunity to study abroad in Switzerland, which deepened my interest in comparative policy and culture. I also enjoy vacationing with friends, including a visit to Vancouver for leisure."

One of these included publishing a summary article based on a policy brief by Andrew Smalley, whom I interned under. This work focused on recent state efforts to improve the efficiency and coordination of workforce development systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking Postsecondary Legislation\n\n\n\nMy primary responsibility at NCSL was tracking and categorizing state legislation related to higher education and workforce development. I monitored and analyzed approximately 2,000 bills across a range of policy areas, including dual enrollment and financial aid, and organized this information into a publicly accessible database to support transparency, public understanding, and policy research.\n\n\n\n\n\nLook through legislation here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Loan Database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook through Student Loan Legislation here!\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this work, I also tracked legislation for NCSL’s Student Loan Bill Tracking Database. This involved organizing enacted legislation within a Power BI database and categorizing bills by topic areas such as loan forgiveness, licensure, oversight, and tax policy to make the data more accessible and easier to analyze."

I was honored to participate in the 17th Annual Economics Scholars Program Conference for Undergraduate Research, where I was session chair and enjoyed exploring the Dallas Federal Reserve. I was also selected to be a part of the Public Policy and International Affairs Program (PPIA) hosted by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at UT Austin, where I got to present a policy case with a team before local officials. Through these events, I was able to learn about new perspectives from my fellow students and meet some the brightest emerging scholars in my field."
